The data is from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center including sea level, concentration of CO2, and temperature.

We connect the data of sea level to a visualized sea level, connect the data of concentration of CO2 to the number of particles and connect the data of the temperature to the color of the sky, so it is very intuitive to see the climate change over the decades.
